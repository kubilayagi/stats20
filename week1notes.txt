Stats 20 Week 1 Notes
-----------------------

Assessments will be twice a week - 
within 7 days => +3
before Aug 3rd with no skips => +2
late or not complete => +1
did not submit => +0

use your student ID for the assessments

skip() can be useful - lets you skip the question and move to the next one

don't reinstall packages during final project, you should have them installed ahead of time

[], [[]], $ => all of these represent the extract operators

	[[]] => returns a vector when extracting from a list

	[] => if you use this in a list, it will return a list

generic vectors are not atomic => you can have different datatypes stored in the same vector

atomic vectors cast all types to the same type if there are different types in the vector

	characters > integers > logical (boolean)

to see the type of data that something is => is() or mode()

data frame:
	rows: observations
	columns: variables

head() gives first 6 values

dim() gives dimensions
	outputs: #rows    #columns

R conforms to the length of the longest vector => recycles from the first value
	shorter one is extended to meet the length of the longest one

	this can be used for an advantage as well

seq(from, to, by) => similar to the : operator

only need to load the library once for each session
	loading libraries should be part of the lab submissions

use load("file.RData") to load a saved R workspace

getwd() and setwd() to read and write working directory -> this is where R workspace will look for data/files to read in

load(url("http://url.com")) => load an online file directly to the R workspace

%>% is the pipe symbol => output of the left hand function is used as the input to the next function

read_excel("filename.xls", sheet = sheet#, skip = #oflinesyouwanttoskip, col_names = TRUE, col_types = NULL)

if you import using the menu, go to history and copy the lines of code over to the source
