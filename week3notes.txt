everything that you need in Rmd file, you need to load it

it doesn't matter if it exists in your memory, you still need to load it

when you want to read data, you need to do: library(readr)

you can create variables (columns) in data sets by just assigning to it

in dplyr, select function choose the variables that you want (same as sql)
	you can either choose the column names or the column numbers

you can use select with a minus sign in order to drop variables from the data set
	i guess by default it gives every variable


Ggplot structure: ggplot(data = dataframe, aes(...)) + geom_[typename]()
